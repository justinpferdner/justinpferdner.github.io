Web scraping is a powerful tool for data scientists, offering the ability to gather valuable information from the vast expanse of the internet. In this blog post, I want to explore the art of web scraping, introduce the process of building a web scraping bot, and discuss web scraping ethics. While I won't delve into complex technical details, having a comprehensive overview of the methods behind scraping the web are important for data scientists looking to harness this technology.

#### Section 1: The Basics of Web Scraping

First off, what is web scraping and how is it used in the world of data science? Web scraping, or web crawling, is the process of extracting data from websites. It allows you to collect information such as text, images, prices, and more, turning unstructured web content into structured data that can be analyzed.

Data scientists can leverage web scraping to gather diverse data sources, enriching their datasets for analysis, research, and modeling. This practice can be applied across various industries, from finance to healthcare, e-commerce, and more.

Now that we understand a little more about scraping the web, letâ€™s begin writing our code. This tutorial will use Python and its web scraping packages that are free and available to use for everyone.

#### Section 2: Building a Web Scraping Bot

The process of building our bot can be broken up into 3 simple steps:

1. Define: Before diving into web scraping, clearly define what data you want to collect and what specific websites you'll target. This ensures that your web scraping project remains focused and efficient.
2. Select: Select a suitable web scraping tool or library, like Rvest, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium, depending on your project's complexity and your coding skills.
3. Build: Finally, begin building your bot by using your chosen tool or library to develop a script to collect data from the websites. This script should mimic a user's interaction with the website, navigating through pages and collecting the desired information.

I will leave it up to you to determine the exact purpose of your bot. For this tutorial, we are interested in scraping information from KSL.com, a popular news source. Our end goal is to analyze trending news topics.

For this tutorial we will be using Selenium, a package built for Python.
