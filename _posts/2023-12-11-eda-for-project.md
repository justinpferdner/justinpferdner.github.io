## Introduction
In my previous post, I explained my process in obtaining data for home prices in and around Salt Lake and Utah county. I aim at answering the question of what the difference in home prices is between the different counties. In this post, I would like to highlight some of my exploratory techniques that I used to analyze the data retrieved. If you would like to learn more about the project, please visit my previous post where I outline my methods on the data collection of home prices.

## Visualizations
Here are some of the most informative visualizations I made for understanding the data. The dataset contains the following columns: Price ($), Address, Bathrooms, Bedrooms, Square Feet, Price per Square foot, Zip Code, State, City, Latitude, Longitude, and County.
